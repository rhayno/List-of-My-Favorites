        <h2> Hacksaw Ridge </h2> <br> <br>
            <p id="fv1"> Hacksaw Ridge is a 2016 biographical war film directed by Mel Gibson and written by Andrew Knight and Robert Schenkkan, based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector directed by Terry Benedict.

                The film focuses on the World War II experiences of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic who, as a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, refused to carry or use a weapon or firearm of any kind. Doss became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty during the Battle of Okinawa. Andrew Garfield stars as Doss, with Sam Worthington, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Hugo Weaving, Rachel Griffiths, and Vince Vaughn in supporting roles.

                Filming took place in Australia from September to December 2015. Hacksaw Ridge was released in the United States on November 4, 2016, grossing $180.4 million worldwide, and received critical acclaim, with Gibson's direction and Garfield's performance earning particular praise. It was widely viewed as a return to form for Gibson, whose career had been in decline following several controversies. Hacksaw Ridge was chosen by the National Board of Review and American Film Institute as one of their top ten films of 2016 respectively,[6][7]and has received numerous awards and nominations. The film received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Garfield, and Best Sound Editing, winning the awards for Best Sound Mixing and Best Film Editing.[8][9] It also received Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor,[10] and 12 AACTA Awards nominations, winning the majority, including Best Film, Best Direction, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor for Garfield, and Best Supporting Actor for Weaving.

                <h2> Chicken Adobo </h2> <br><br>
                <p class="p1" id="fv2">
                    A dish and cooking process native to the Philippines, adobo refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. This marinade also includes other herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns.
                    Cooking food in vinegar is no foreign concept to us Filipinos. In pre-colonial times, our ancestors used to cook seafood in vinegar in order to preserve their freshness. Many regard adobo as a spin on kinilaw, which is another traditional cooking method. Kinilaw refers mainly to cooking raw seafood in vinegar and spices. Another similar process is paksiw, which utilizes meat broth in vinegar and spices.
                    What really sets adobo apart is the presence of soy sauce in its marinade. While vinegar has a pungent aroma and a very distinctly sour taste, soy sauce is on both the sweeter and saltier side. A staple in any Asian household, soy sauce (or toyo) definitely helps in bringing out chicken adobo’s savory taste.
                    (Here’s a fun fact: did you know that there are different kinds of soy sauce? In Japan especially, there are five different kinds of soy sauce that each have their own unique flavors and uses. The most common one you’ll find in markets is dark soy sauce, or koikuchi. With a deeper color than most other types, dark soy sauce is packed with flavor –– perfect for your chicken adobo!)
                    Adobo also contains dry bay leaves in its recipe. Although you aren’t to eat them whole, bay leaves lend their subtle, deep flavors to this umami dish. It may not be the star of the show, but your chicken adobo wouldn’t be complete without it. However, you can choose to substitute this herb with basil if you can’t find it at stores.

                <h2> MIR4 </h2> <br><br>
                <p class="p2" id="fv3">
                    MIR4 is the first game developed and published by Korean firm, Wemade Co., Ltd. It is an
                    MMORPG that works as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) game as well, enabling players not just to
                    enjoy its massive open world but also to earn real money in the process as well. NFT games
                    have been continuously on the rise largely because of its allure for players to actually earn
                    money with the hours they invest into playing games. MIR4 essentially sets itself apart by being
                    a top quality MMORPG that is above par in its genre even without the blockchain elements.

                    Despite a huge chunk of MIR4’s explosive success being attributable to being an NFT-based
                    MMORPG, we will be focusing more on the gameplay elements. MIR4 certainly offers a plethora
                    of content and features that can appear overwhelming especially for beginners in the MMORPG
                    scene and the purpose of the beginner's guide is to direct a faster and more efficient path
                    towards growth and progression.

                    In any case, the money-earning part of MIR4 will be dependent not just on time and effort
                    invested but in power you amass as well. To some extent, having a solid grasp of all the basic
                    features and mechanics that greet you augments your capacity to move forward and a speedy
                    growth and proaression path in anv MMORPG is always the best way to go.
